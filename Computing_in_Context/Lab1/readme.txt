Hi! My name is Flora and I am currently a Master of International Affairs student at Columbia SIPA.  
I’m originally from France and studied History at the Univestiy of Oxford before coming to New York. 
I have gained professional experience across both the private and public sectors. 
I worked in consulting in London, where I focused on healthcare and consumer investments.
I am currently interning at UNESCO’s Education Sector, supporting strategic planning, monitoring, and global reporting on education initiatives.
My academic interests include economic development, education policy, and international governance.  
In my free time, I enjoy reading, baking, and exploring new cuisines.  
I look forward to learning Python this semester!
